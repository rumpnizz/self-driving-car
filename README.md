Big thanks to Radu for this amazing course!
You can find his youtube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/RaduMariescuIstodor).

Simulates cars to drive on a highway.

##### Run in browser.
* Save button - Saves current neural brain to the browsers local storage.
* Trash can - Deletes saved brain from neural storage.

Don't ask me to explain the neural network. No idea :D


After a couple of iterations, I got the brain saved in `src/js/data/best-car.js` \
Uncomment the following in `index.html` to use this brain (local storage need to be empty):
```
<script src="js/car.js"></script>
<!-- <script src="js/data/best-car.js"></script> --> <-- uncomment this line
<script src="js/main.js"></script>
```
